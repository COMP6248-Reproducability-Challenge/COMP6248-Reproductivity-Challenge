Conclusion

We reproduced the meta-learning-based few-shot text classification model with distributional

signatures on five relevant datasets. Almost all results are consistent with that shown in the paper.

These experiments show that using distributional signatures as the inputs of meta-learning model can

achieve better performance than using lexical words directly. However, we failed to fully reproduce

the experiments due to limited computational resources and the implementation details for using

BERT. We have tried to inquire the author for more implementation details and further adjust our

experiments to achieve better performance.
